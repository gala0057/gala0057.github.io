Reflection:

I used simple html and css coding to build my homepage and about page. I used bootstrap for the gallery and footer.
I originally wanted to code it myself for the gallery and footer but due to lack of time and practice on javascript,
i just used bootstrap. 

I wanted my design for my portfolio to be simple and straightforward. I make sure that the main highlight of my web portfolio
is the gallery section that's why i used bootstrap so it could be interactive. In the future, i want to make a gallery by hard coding.

I learned that layout for the whole website is important because it reflects your skill at designing a website. I realized that 
i need more practice at javascript because it is widely used nowadays and its used on popular websites.
